1)the problems i faced while starting tomcat:
ps:i reinstalled jdk and jre to default forlders where they were pointing i.e to C drive
	1)do not start it from xampp control panel
	2)go to tomcat directory in xampp and point cmd there
	3)cd bin
	4)set JRE_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_45	(without quotes)
	5)set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45
	6)set CATALINA=E:\xampp2\tomcat
	4)startup
	
it showed me errors : 32 bit .dll incompatible with 64 bit platform:  Can't load IA 32-bit .dll on a AMD 64-bit platform
	for this i downloaded 64 bit .dll file and replaced it with tcnative-1.dll file qhich was 32 bit in xampp/tomcat/bin folder
	
then i got error:
 org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
SEVERE: An incompatible version 1.1.12 of the APR based Apache Tomcat Native library is installed, while Tomcat requires version 1.1.17 
Jan 25, 2011 3:21:05 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init

sthg like this but i searched for it.people said APR just enhances efficiency so even if its not working thats fine

then i got errors in xml file
some were typing errors while one error was java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException: ISO-8851-1

i searched for it.replaced ISO-8551 with ISO-8559 ans it worked fine!!

..and voilaa!! my site ran successfully!!! hurray 


to compile yor program in development directory :
go to the development library
javac -classpath /yourpath/tomcat/lib/servlet-api.jar -d classes src/yourJavaFileName.java 		//path where servlet-api.jar lives or u downloaded to
